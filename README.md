# cancer-prediction
Final project for UCLA graduate course, CS 205 - Health Analytics. 

Built machine learning models that utilize data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm) in attempt to classify individuals who have ever been told they have cancer, and those who have not.

Project description and skeleton code provided here (credit to the teaching assistant, Orpaz Goldstein): https://github.com/orpgol/Opportunistic.

Please see manipulated skeleton code in nhanes.py and Demo_Dataset.ipynb for my solution, and a thorough explanation of my solution and results generated in the report.
